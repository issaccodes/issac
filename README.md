# Hi, I'm Issac 👋

I'm a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with a love for building seamless web applications. My stack is powered by:

- ⚛️ **React** and **Next.js** for crafting dynamic, server-rendered user interfaces
- 🚀 **Node.js** and **Express** for building scalable back-end services
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL** and **Prisma** for reliable and efficient data management

I thrive on creating intuitive user experiences and robust back-end solutions that bring ideas to life. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest trends in web development or contributing to open-source projects.

Let's build something amazing together!
