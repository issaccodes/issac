### Welcome to My Github!
Hi there! 👋 I'm **Issac** 👨‍💻, a passionate self-taught developer exploring the amazing world of computers. 

**🌟 Fun Fact**: I have a 24-inch vertical jump! 🏀 (Still deciding if that’s useful for debugging... 🤔)

🚀 ***Let's Connect!*** : Feel free to explore, star ⭐, or fork 🍴 my repos. I love connecting with fellow developers!


### Welcome! 🎉

- Just a coder with too many ideas and not enough Ctrl+Z.
- 🐛 Bugs are my pets, I just can’t get rid of them.
- Famous last words: “This should work now.”
- This is my second (and smaller) account for questionable experiments.
- Enjoy the chaos! 🚀
